              I’m a full-stack web developer and storyteller whose
              experiences in web project management, journalism and customer
              service have shaped me into a detail-oriented, product-focused
              problem solver.
          </p>

            <p>
              I am currently enrolled in a full stack development bootcamp
              at Johns Hopkins University. So far in the bootcamp, I built
              upon my strong foundation in HTML and CSS while learning the
              basics of JavaScript and JQuery, focusing all my projects on
              mobile-first designs.
          </p>

            <p>
              In addition to the bootcamp, I work full time managing content
              and search engine optimization on a local hospital’s
              consumer-facing website. My time in this role has helped me
              learn about crafting a smooth user experience and how to
              develop content that ranks high in search engines. My degree
              and subsequent career in journalism, specifically working at a
              daily newspaper, shaped my ability to work in deadline-driven
              environments with a focus on detail. The combination of these
              experiences gave me a strong foundation for my future as a web
              developer and furthering my career in web marketing.

              In my free time, I play drums in a cover band. Part of my band
              duties is promoting upcoming shows and managing our brand. You
            can see examples of my work on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/liesfromgranny" class="body-link"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram account</a> and on&nbsp;
            <a href="http://liesfromgranny.com" className="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our website</a>, which I designed.

              I also enjoy photography. I took the photos on this page -
              photos of me were using a timer - and my photos can be
            viewed on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drumminup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="body-link">Instagram
              account</a>.
